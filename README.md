# Campus Walk: Find Friends on the Go

## Overview
This project is a React and TypeScript-based campus map application designed to help students find friends who are walking near them at a given time. Users can log in, record their daily schedules, and visualize potential meetups with friends while walking between locations. 

The application extends an existing campus mapping tool by incorporating spatial search algorithms for efficient proximity detection.
